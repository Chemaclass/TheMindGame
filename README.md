# The Mind Game 

This is a compilation in different computer languages of the same algorithm inspired by the game ["The Mind Card"](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind).

- [Java](./TheMindGameJava/)
- [PHP](./TheMindGamePhp/)

## How to play

- Each player has the same amount of cards as the current level.
- Every level consists of putting down (randomly) each player one of their cards(the lowest) into the pile desk.
- The goal is to put down face-up all the cards in ascending order from each player.
- If a player puts down a card with a lower number than the last card from the pile desk, then the game is over and it must start from the beginning.
